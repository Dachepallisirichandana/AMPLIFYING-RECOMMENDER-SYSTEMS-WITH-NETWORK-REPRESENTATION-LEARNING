            <p align="justify">With the popularity of social network applications, more and more recommender
systems utilize trust relationships to improve the performance of traditional recommendation algorithms.
Social-network-based recommendation algorithms generally assume that users with trust relations usually
share common interests. However, the performance of most of the existing social-network-based recommen-
dation algorithms is limited by the coarse-grained and sparse trust relationships. In this paper, we propose a
network representation learning enhanced recommendation algorithm. Specically, we rst adopt a network
representation technique to embed social network into a low-dimensional space, and then utilize the low-
dimensional representations of users to infer ne-grained and dense trust relationships between users.
Finally, we integrate the ne-grained and dense trust relationships into the matrix factorization model to
learn user and item latent feature vectors. The experimental results on real-world datasets show that our
proposed approach outperforms traditional social-network-based recommendation algorithms.</p>
